# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
  This analysis was commisioned by the Colorado Board of Elections to analysis and determine the results of a recent Colordo Congressional election. The objectives of this analysis are as follows:
  
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
  2. Gather a complete list of candidates who received votes
  3. Calculate the total number of votes that each candidate received
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate won
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on the results of the popular vote
  
## Resources
  Data sourced from election_results.csv
  Software used to write script and run code was Python 3.9.12 and VS Code 1.71.2 (Universal)

## Analysis Summary
  The total number of votes cast in the election was 369,711. The county with the highest voter turnout was Denver county with 82.8% of the total vote (306,055). Jefferson county had the second highest voter turnout at 10.5% of the total vote (38,855). And Arapahoe county had the lowest voter turnout at 6.7% of the total votes (24,801). 
  The winner of the popular vote was Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the total votes counted. Charles Casper Stokham came in second place with 85,213 votes or 23.0% of the total votes cast. And Raymon Anthony Doane had the least amount of votes at 11,606 votes or 3.1% of the total votes counted.

## Challenges and Further Uses
  Some of the challenges faced were issues with initial creation of the script but once those had been debugged, the script was able to be built upon to add a deeper level of analysis than originally requested at commission. 
  A couple of ways that this script could be used in the future are to run analysis on more vraiables. For example; age of the voter, socioeconomic status, level of education, or religious affiliation. It would be interesting to see how these variables would affect the analysis of the data. Would they deepen the analysis and reveal further trends in voting patterns? A second way to use this script in the furture would be to run build further levels of analysis of the existing data set. For example, calculating the percentage in each county that each candidate received. This would most likely reveal trends in the data that would otherwise go unnoticed.
